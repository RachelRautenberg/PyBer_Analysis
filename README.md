# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 : PyBer


## OVERVIEW
An analysis of PyBer data was completed in an effort to better understand utilization and consider variables such as driver counts and fare costs in order to make business decisions the will increase accessibility of PyBer RideSharing in underserved areas. 

## RESULTS

We can see from the data that rural cities have less drivers, represented by the smaller bubbles; there are also fewer rides and overall higher fare costs. There is a trending shift as proven by the data, suburban cities have more rides, more drivers, and lower fares than rural, and urban has the most rides, most drivers, and lowest fares.  In areas that are more populated there is more usage of PyBer RideSharing, which has likely driven the driver counts up and keeps cost lower as the ride share is in use more than it is idle. 

The next set of visuals supports this and also provides a bit more insight.  While there are more rides taken in urban cities, there is also greater variance.  The inner quartile is much larger, as is the range, for urban cities; interestingly urban is also were we see our only outlier in the data.  Suburban cities have a smaller spread than urban, and rural has smaller spread than suburban.  This leads me to believe that as long as the city type is classified correctly, expanding Pyber in rural areas may be easier to acheive because the data is showing that the number of rides in rural cities is more predictable and has less deviation.

As we view the fares by city type we see that rural cities have larger fares and larger range for fares.  If V. Isualize is wanting to make PyBer more accessible, she may want to consider what is the driving factor of the fare prices.  If the fares charged are higher due to lower competition in drivers, could the fare be standardized, for example.  If the fares are higher because of the distances traveled in rural areas, then V. Isualize may want to consider a marketing campaign that showcases what PyBer can do for those needing rides in rural cities and if possible highlight cheaper fares compared to owning a car, if such data could be presented. Another thought, when looking at the number of drivers, that one would want to consider is what are the demands and does the driver count meet the needs.  It could be that rural cities have less rides because there are fewer drivers. One would assume then, that as long as there is need, increasing drivers would increase rides; increasing drivers also by nature increases accessibility.
